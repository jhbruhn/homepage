Moin!

I am Jan-Henrik, **computer science** student at TU Dortmund, Germany.

My primary interests lie in the field of embedded systems,
but you might find other things on my [github](https://github.com/jhbruhn).

Welcome to my homepage.
This is where I keep my stash of notes on different things.
Right now, the amount of such notes is very low, but this may
improve in the future.

If you wanna reach out, hit me up via
[email](mailto:hi-from-www@jhbruhn.de) or
[matrix](https://matrix.to/#/@jhbruhn:jhbruhn.de) (_fancy!_).
